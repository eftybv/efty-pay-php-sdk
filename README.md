## Getting started

### gRPC
Under the hood the Efty Pay PHP SDK uses gRPC & Protobuf. If not enabled yet, you'll need to install & enable these extensions on your server.

#### Install & enable the gRPC extension

```
sudo pecl install grpc
```

After you install the gRPC extension, make sure to to enable the extension in your `php.ini` file:
```
extension=grpc.so
```

For detailed instructions, visit the official [gRPC PHP readme](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.66.0/src/php/README.md).

  ]
